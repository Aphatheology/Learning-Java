# Week 4

## Assignment 1
1. Study and differentiate between is-a-relationship and has-a-relationship.
2. Create a static method that accepts two parameters (any number type) and returns a float type. Create five overloads of this method.

## Assignment 2

1. **Differentiate between Checked and Unchecked Exception**

   In Java, exceptions are categorized into two main types: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions (also known as runtime exceptions). Understand the differences between these two types of exceptions.

2. **Create an Exception Class called `DriverOverSpeedException`**

   Create a custom exception class named `DriverOverSpeedException` that extends an appropriate exception class (e.g., `Exception` or a subclass of it). This custom exception will be used to handle situations where a driver is speeding excessively.

3. **Create a class called `Motor` with a method `drive` and a main method**

   Implement a class called `Motor` that contains a method named `drive` which accepts a `speed` parameter. Inside the `drive` method, check if the speed is above 500. If the speed exceeds 500, throw the `DriverOverSpeedException` you created in step 2.

   Create a `main` method in the `Motor` class to demonstrate how to use the `drive` method and handle the custom exception appropriately.

Please make sure to thoroughly understand the concepts and principles involved in each part of this assignment.
